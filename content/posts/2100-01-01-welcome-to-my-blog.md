Welcome to the first post on my blog! (Future-dated to pin at the top)

This is likely to be infrequently updated, if my usual writing pattern is anything to go by. My initial expectation is that I will use it for long-form technical comment and opinion that does not fit anywhere else.

My Twitter feed [@kittylyst](https://twitter.com/kittylyst) is probably where I am most active, but that is very much a personal account and only has a fairly small amount of technical content on it - and rather more cat pictures, dumb jokes and my personal political views. Caveat lector!

For anything specifically work-related, you might also try [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kittylyst/)
