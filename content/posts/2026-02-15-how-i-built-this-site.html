<p>Inspired by several of my friends and colleagues (with a particular shout-out to <a href="https://hollycummins.com/">Holly Cummins</a>),
    I decided to rebuild my personal / author site. It's been something of a journey.</p>
<p>Although I started developing websites in 1997, I haven't done much in the way of JS and HTML for
    many years. The last time I wrote JS professionally as a major part of my job was over 20 years ago.
    My last website was written in Gatsby for me by a contractor - I picked up enough React while I was at New Relic to
    write simple components when there were no front-end devs available - and figured that I could maintain it after the
    initial delivery. To a point, this was true, but I never felt completely comfortable working with it, and that added
    additional friction, and I updated less often as a result.</p>
<p>So, while evaluating options and wanting to stick closer to a tech stack that would allow me to focus on the writing
    and creativity, not the maintenance I discovered <a href="https://iamroq.com/">Roq</a>, which is a static site generator
    built on top of <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a>.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600">If you're not familiar with Quarkus</h2>
<p>Quarkus is one of the most popular Java frameworks - not as well-known as Spring Boot but (as far as we can tell,
    estimating these numbers is notoriously difficult) probably second most widely-used for Java services.</p>
<p>Quarkus was originally designed to be Kubernetes-native and to integrate well with the emerging native compilation
    technologies for Java (such as GraalVM Native Mode and Project Leyden). However, in the best tradition of
    "the street finds its own uses for things", it turns out that Quarkus's model of "shifting computation left"
    (so that as much work is done at build time, in order to reduce startup time) has other benefits.</p>
<p>In particular, Quarkus Dev Mode provides a tight developer loop, enabling rapid development and what has
    become known as "Quarkus Developer Joy". It isn't an exaggeration to say that Quarkus really does seem to
    strike a chord in many developers who start to use it.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600">So where does Roq fit in?</h2>
<p>For Roq, it turns out that building on top of Quarkus already gives us a lot of what's needed for an SSG:</p>
<ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 my-3">
    <li>Quarkus provides Qute - a typesafe template engine</li>
    <li>Roq Plugins and Themes are implemented as Quarkus extensions</li>
    <li>Quarkus dev mode serves files statically and dynamically</li>
    <li>Quarkus Dependency injection (CDI) extends and binds data and templates together</li>
    <li>Quarkus extensions can be used with Roq (e.g. the Quarkus web-bundler)</li>
    <li>Full use of the Quarkus test framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Roq is then a "rock" on top of Quarkus, providing some familiar SSG capabilities, and some unique ones:</p>
<ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 my-3">
    <li>Create endpoints based on convention-over-configuration</li>
    <li>Extensive use of Frontmatter for metadata</li>
    <li>Define data files (e.g. yml or json) and use them in templates</li>
    <li>Additional plugins and themes</li>
    <li>Export fom the Quarkus app to a static site</li>
    <li>Use GitHub Actions for publishing to GH Pages (or elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600">How do I use Roq?</h2>
<p>One of the things that stands out for me about Roq is the use of multiple processing pipelines.
    I personally use HTML files for items with content, and Markdown for anything which is metadata-only.
    My HTML files are valid (except for being fragments that are intended to be inserted into templates).
    The source for this site is <a href="https://github.com/kittylyst/kittylyst-roq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fitting in to the theme of not doing much front-end dev, two tools I've found to be very useful are
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> - because it fits into how I (as a
    fundamentally backend person) feel about frontend and <a href=" https://mvnpm.org/doc" target="_blank">MVNPM</a>,
    which bridges any require JS modules into the Maven build that Quarkus uses (other build tools can
    be used with Quarkus, but I recommend that you don't). This is much easier than dealing with the horrors
    of NPM directly.</p>
<p>My Roq site has several routes, each of which is represented in the navbar, and
    corresponds to a single HTML file under the content/ directory. Roq uses convention-over-configuration,
    so that, for example, about.html is mapped to /about as a route. Roq also has a concept of collections,
    which are entities (such as blog posts) that may grow over time. This site has 5 separate collections for articles
    (metadata only), books, blog entries, upcoming events and videos, and each is handled under a separate
    route.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600">What about AI tools?</h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>My primary AI coding tool for this is Cursor, which I have found to be a useful addition to my toolbelt
    (albeit not transformative) - I will expand fully on my experiences with AI tools in a future post. tl;dr -
    it's somewhat complex and nebulous and I need more space and time to think about it and unpack it.
</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600">How does the publication workflow operate?</h2>
<p>My publishing wokflow is to GH, and then via an automatic trigger that sends the generated static files to
    <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. The relevant actions are in the repo.</p>
