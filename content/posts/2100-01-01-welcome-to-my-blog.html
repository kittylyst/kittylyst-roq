Welcome to the first post on my blog! (Future-dated to pin at the top)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is likely to be infrequently updated, if my usual writing pattern is anything to go by.
My initial expectation is that I will use it for long-form technical comment and opinion that
does not fit anywhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Mastodon feed <a href="https://mastodon.social/@kittylyst"  target="_blank">@kittylyst@mastodon.social</a> is probably where I am most active,
but that is very much a personal account and only has a fairly small amount of technical
content on it - and rather more cat pictures, dumb jokes and my personal political views.<br/><br/>
Caveat lector!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full contact details are on my <a href="/about">About page</a> or for anything specifically
work-related, you might also try <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kittylyst/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>
