description: Ben discusses the Method Handles API
---

<p>The Method Handles API was first introduced in Java 7 (almost 15 years ago) but despite this
maturity, seems not to have fully permeated into the collective consciousness of developers.
Instead, the ancient Reflection API is still more familiar, despite its serious shortcomings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this talk, Ben will explain what Method Handles are used for, how they differ from
Reflection and why they are an extremely useful tool for modern advanced Java programming.
We'll cover:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Method types &amp; Lookups</li>
    <li>Method &amp; Var Handles</li>
    <li>Lambda expressions</li>
    <li>Replacing Unsafe</li>
    <li>Rewiring the internals of Reflection</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude the talk, we'll look at a set of use cases where Method Handles are an
excellent general-purpose tool for building dynamic capabilities in Java.</p>
