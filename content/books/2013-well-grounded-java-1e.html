description: Short Description of The Well-Grounded Java Developer
---

The Well-Grounded Java Developer was a ground-breaking text that introduced the reader to advanced
topics in the Java language and platform. Covering Java 7, the book delves deeper
into aspects of the Java platform and software lifecycle, and investigates the role of non-Java
languages on the JVM -- with primary topics such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Polyglot programming</li>
    <li>Dependency injection</li>
    <li>Multithreaded programming</li>
    <li>Sound build and CI practices</li>
    <li>What's new in Java 7</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discussions of theoretical concepts were interspersed with practical applications of theory and short introductions
to leading Open Source tools and frameworks. The expected audience is developers at the start of their
careers who are looking to gain additional experience and start on the path of becoming
first-rate developers.
