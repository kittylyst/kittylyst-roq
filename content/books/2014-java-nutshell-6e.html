description: Short Description of Java in a Nutshell (6th Ed)
---

<p>The sixth edition of Java in a Nutshell was the first to be written after the revival of the series,
and covers Java 8. It represented a major change in direction for the series, with the removal of the
detailed API reference, which had become too large to contain in a printed book. Instead, the book
used a new approach centred on key topics such as:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Java's syntax and approach to OO</li>
    <li>Java's Collections</li>
    <li>Concurrency &amp; Memory</li>
    <li>I/O (including asynchronous I/O)</li>
    <li>Classloading &amp; Reflection</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first part provides a fast-paced introduction to the Java programming language and the core
aspects of the Java runtime platform. The second part is a working guide to core APIs and concepts.</p>
