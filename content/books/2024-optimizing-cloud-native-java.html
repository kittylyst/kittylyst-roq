Java Performance Analysis takes on a new dimension for cloud-based applications. Not only do
engineers need to understand how to get the best single-JVM performance out of their applications,
they increasingly need to know more about the clustered cloud environments those applications will run in.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optimizing Cloud Native Java brings together a variety of practical techniques and performance
methodologies. Deep dives on low-level aspects, such as Java Garbage Collection and code execution
(including JIT compilation) are combined with chapters on observability and deployment tools. The end
result is to achieve quantitative and verifiable improvements in modern Java applications.
