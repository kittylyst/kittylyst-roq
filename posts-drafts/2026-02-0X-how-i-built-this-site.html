Inspired by several of my friends and colleagues (with a particular shout-out to Holly Cummins),
I decided to rebuild my personal / author site.</p>
<p>I started developing websites in 1997, but I haven't done much in the way of JS and HTML for
many years. My last website was written in Gatsby for me by a contractor - I picked up enough
React while I was at New Relic to write simple components when there were no front-end devs
available - and figured that I could maintain it after the initial delivery. To a point, this
was true, but I never felt as comfortable working in it as I did in other options.</p>
