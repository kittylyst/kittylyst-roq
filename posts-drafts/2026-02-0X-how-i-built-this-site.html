Inspired by several of my friends and colleagues (with a particular shout-out to <a href="https://hollycummins.com/">Holly Cummins</a>),
I decided to rebuild my personal / author site. It's been something of a journey.</p>
<p>Although I started developing websites in 1997, I haven't done much in the way of JS and HTML for
many years. The last time I wrote JS professionally as a major part of my job was over 20 years ago.
My last website was written in Gatsby for me by a contractor - I picked up enough React while I was at New Relic to
write simple components when there were no front-end devs available - and figured that I could maintain it after the
initial delivery. To a point, this was true, but I never felt completely comfortable working with it.</p>
<p>So, while evaluating options, and wanting to stick closer to a tech stack that would allow me to focus on the writing
and creativity, not the maintenance I discovered <a href="https://iamroq.com/">Roq</a>, which is a static site generator
built on top of <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a>.</p>
<h2>If you're not familiar with Quarkus</h2>
<p>Quarkus is one of the most popular Java frameworks - not as well-known as Spring Boot but (as far as we can tell,
estimating these numbers is notoriously difficult) probably second most widely-used among Java services.

Quarkus Dev Mode

<h2>So where does Roq fit in?</h2>
<p>Quarkus already gives us a lot of what's needed for an SSG:

Quarkus has Qute as Type-Safe template engine , some sugar for Roq.
Roq Plugins and Themes are Quarkus extensions.
Quarkus allow to serve files statically and dynamically.
CDI allows to extend and bind data and templates together.
Quarkus extensions can be used with Roq, the most use-full is the Quarkus Web-Bundler (to bundle script, styles and web deps without any config).
Quarkus test framework.


Roq is a rock on top of Quarkus:

Create endpoints for all your static site based on conventions (dir structure and Frontmatter data).
Allow to define data files (yml or json) and consume them in templates.
Provide plugins and themes.
Add a command to export you Quarkus app as a static site.
A GitHub Action for automation.</p>
<h2>How do I use Roq?</h2>
<p>One of the things that stands out for me about Roq is the use of multiple processing pipelines.
    I personally use HTML files for items with content, and Markdown for anything which is metadata-only.

    Fitting in to the theme of not doing much front-end dev, two tools I've found to be very useful are
    Tailwind, and <a href=" https://mvnpm.org/doc" target="_blank">MVNPM</a>, which bridges any require JS
    modules into the Maven build that Quarkus uses.</p>
