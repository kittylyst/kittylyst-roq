<p>I use on the default settings. This is quite deliberate,
    as I am interested in the mass-market experience, not the enthusiast / hobbyist case. In general, I regard myself as
    "on-the-fence" regarding AI coding tools. I can see benefit in the tools, in a number of use cases, and both
    the capability and the range of applicability is both improving. However, I have not personally encountered
    the transformative "end of human coding" experience to date. I still encounter fairly hard limitations </p>
