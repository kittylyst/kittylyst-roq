This post collects some of my thoughts about what skills a good Java developer needs.
It's focused on developers who have just joined the Java community.

If you're interested in the general needs of entry-level developers, you might also like ....

take some time to do proper prep before the interviews, and don't jump at the first thing that you find. Key areas to study up on:

1.) Core Java. Collections and Streams especially. Java's support for "slightly functional programming".

2.) Git. Every developer today needs to be good at git - learn the commands and some of the underlying theory if you can.

3.) A bit of Docker and Linux command line would definitely help as well.

4.) A databases & SQL refresher also very useful

5.) Spring / Spring Boot. It's changed a lot since 2014, but there are lots of great free resources out there.

Polish those before interviews, and then go in, be calm and honest & with a fair following wind you'll find a good new role in the Java space.
